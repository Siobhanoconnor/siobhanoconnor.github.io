<H1> <b> UMaine Rugby </b> </H1>
Another one of my sister's college activities imposed on me. My sister did rugby at her school when whe was in coleege and told me that rugby would be a good sport
for me to do as I couldn't do color guard up at the the University of Maine, as the school didn't offer it. I'm used to fighting and having to work out a lot, so rugby wasn't
a daunting sport for me. When I went to the first practice, I quickly realized I wasn't the weakest one there, but I wasn't the most built one there. And I very much wasn't
the typical build for someone who plays rugby.
<p> As a fun fact, my position on rugby constantly changes but I must often play Wing and Hooker. So, I am a UMaine Women's Rugby Hooker</p>
