<H1> <b> Going GREEK </b> </H1>
<p>When I first came to school, I didn't think I was going to join a sorority. I thought they were not worth my time or my money. I thought I'd be able to make friends on my own.
My sister was in a sorority while she was in college and told me that I should do the same. That we could be 'double sisters' if I got into her sorority.
So, to get my sister to stop talking, I went to rush week and took my chances. Now normally, I'm a very approachable person, but for some reason I guess I was very shy
which I believe gave somewhat of the wrong impression of me. After a few days, preference round came and I wasn't given a preference bid from my sister's sorority.
This devastated me as I only got called back for other sororities. Eventually, I came to love my sorority, Phi Mu. They've become my family, a majority my friends, my support network
and overall some of the greatest people I've met</p>
