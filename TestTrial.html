<H1> <B> Hello </B> </H1>
<P>  My name is Siobhan O'Connor and I'm currently in my second semester at the University of Maine as a Marketing major.
    I'm 18 years old currently but I'll be 19 on March 18.
I mostly grew up in Chatham, NJ, having moved around from close by towns before settling down at the age of 8.
I'm the youngest child of 3 as well as being a child of a nasty divorce that has continually put strain on my family.
