<H1> <b>Color Guard</b> </H1>

All through high school I participated in my high school's marching band and more specifically the color guard. I've competed in 6 seasons; 4 fall and 2 winter. My shows were:
A Night at the Opera, Waterfalls, Journey to a New Land, Red, The Great Silk Road, and Land of the Free.
<p> Color guard was an up and down experience as it held some of my greatest moments to some of my lowest. I had amazing friends that were ot only in guard with me but also in the
band. My instructors were terrible but I pushed through because I knew I was better than some overweight, stupid abuser.</p>
<p> Throughout my career in color guard, I've been able to travel up in rank, earning myself multiple Varsity letters as well as the title as Captain in my junior and senior years.
I led my team to championships and first place spots and national rankings</p>
